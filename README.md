# My Personal Project

## Movie Sorter

As an avid film enthusiast I wanted to create an application that 
would keep track of the movies I've watched, this application is for others that share 
my interest in watching movies. This application will allow the user to add in movies and then 
categorize, filter, and rank those movies. For the filtering of the movies, 
the user will be able to use this aspect to find certain movie(s), whether it's by name, rating, or category.


 **User Stories**:
 - As a user, I want to be able to add a movie.
 - As a user, I want to be able to view my movies based on category or rating.
 - As a user, I want to be able to rate a movie after adding it to the list.
 - As a user, I want to be able to search the name of one of my movies.
 - As a user, I want to be able to save and load my movie list.
 - As a user, I want to be given the option to save my movie list before quitting.

//todo popupmenu with option for each movie to be able to edit name, rating, category, delete, copy.
